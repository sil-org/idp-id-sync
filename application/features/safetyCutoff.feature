Feature: Preventing too many changes at once to protect against iffy data.

  Scenario Outline: Preventing too many user-deactivations in a full sync
    Given <activeInBroker> users are active in the ID Broker
      And running a full sync would deactivate <numToDeactivate> users
      And the safety cutoff is <safetyCutoff>
    When I sync all the users from the ID Store to the ID Broker
    Then an exception <exceptionOrNot> have been thrown

    Examples:
      | activeInBroker | numToDeactivate | safetyCutoff | exceptionOrNot |
      |      100       |      0          |     0.15     |  should NOT    |

  Scenario Outline: Preventing too many user-creations in a full sync
    Given <activeInBroker> users are active in the ID Broker
      And running a full sync would create <numToCreate> users
      And the safety cutoff is <safetyCutoff>
    When I sync all the users from the ID Store to the ID Broker
    Then an exception <exceptionOrNot> have been thrown

    Examples:
      | activeInBroker | numToCreate | safetyCutoff | exceptionOrNot |
      |      100       |      0      |     0.15     |  should NOT    |

  Scenario Outline: Preventing too many combined changes in an incremental sync
    Given <activeInBroker> users are active in the ID Broker
      And an incremental sync would add <add>, update <update>, and deactivate <deact> users
      And the safety cutoff is <safetyCutoff>
    When I run an incremental sync
    Then an exception <exceptionOrNot> have been thrown

    Examples:
